This issue tracker is the finished product from Mosh Hamedani's course [`Next.js Projects: Build an Issue Tracker`](https://codewithmosh.com/p/nextjs-projects-issue-tracker) at [Code With Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/). The course assumes a fundamental understanding of the React library and having completed the first course, [`Mastering Next.js 13 with Typescript`](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-next-js-13-with-typescript), in a two part Next.js tutorial series.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
